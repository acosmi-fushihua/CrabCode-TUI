//! Path-level transaction locking for acosmi-memory operations.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//! - [`TransactionRecord`] — tracks a single transaction's lifecycle and locks.
//! - [`PathLock`] — file-system-based path-level locking (normal / rm / mv).
//! - [`TransactionManager`] — manages transaction creation, commit, rollback,
//!   and background timeout cleanup.
//!
//! All file-system operations are delegated to the injected
//! [`FileSystem`](acosmi_memory_session::traits::FileSystem) trait, keeping this
//! crate fully decoupled from any concrete storage backend.
