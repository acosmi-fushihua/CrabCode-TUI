## CC FEATURES REFERENCE (pick from these for features_to_try):
1. **MCP Servers**: Connect CrabCode to external tools, databases, and APIs via Model Context Protocol.
   - How to use: Run \`crabcode mcp add <server-name> -- <command>\`
   - Good for: database queries, Slack integration, GitHub issue lookup, connecting to internal APIs

2. **Custom Skills**: Reusable prompts you define as markdown files that run with a single /command.
   - How to use: Create \`.crabcode/skills/commit/SKILL.md\` with instructions. Then type \`/commit\` to run it.
   - Good for: repetitive workflows - /commit, /review, /test, /deploy, /pr, or complex multi-step workflows

3. **Hooks**: Shell commands that auto-run at specific lifecycle events.
   - How to use: Add to \`.crabcode/settings.json\` under "hooks" key.
   - Good for: auto-formatting code, running type checks, enforcing conventions

4. **Headless Mode**: Run CrabCode non-interactively from scripts and CI/CD.
   - How to use: \`crabcode -p "fix lint errors" --allowedTools "Edit,Read,Bash"\`
   - Good for: CI/CD integration, batch code fixes, automated reviews

5. **Task Agents**: CrabCode spawns focused sub-agents for complex exploration or parallel work.
   - How to use: CrabCode auto-invokes when helpful, or ask "use an agent to explore X"
   - Good for: codebase exploration, understanding complex systems

IMPORTANT for crabcode_md_additions: PRIORITIZE instructions that appear MULTIPLE TIMES in the user data. If user told CrabCode the same thing in 2+ sessions (e.g., 'always run tests', 'use TypeScript'), that's a PRIME candidate - they shouldn't have to repeat themselves.

  const atAGlancePrompt = `You're writing an "At a Glance" summary for a CrabCode usage insights report for CrabCode users. The goal is to help them understand their usage and improve how they can use CrabCode better, especially as models improve.

Use this 4-part structure:

1. **What's working** - What is the user's unique style of interacting with CrabCode and what are some impactful things they've done? You can include one or two details, but keep it high level since things might not be fresh in the user's memory. Don't be fluffy or overly complimentary. Also, don't focus on the tool calls they use.

2. **What's hindering you** - Split into (a) CrabCode's fault (misunderstandings, wrong approaches, bugs) and (b) user-side friction (not providing enough context, environment issues -- ideally more general than just one project). Be honest but constructive.

3. **Quick wins to try** - Specific CrabCode features they could try from the examples below, or a workflow technique if you think it's really compelling. (Avoid stuff like "Ask CrabCode to confirm before taking actions" or "Type out more context up front" which are less compelling.)

4. **Ambitious workflows for better models** - As we move to much more capable models over the next 3-6 months, what should they prepare for? What workflows that seem impossible now will become possible? Draw from the appropriate section below.

Keep each section to 2-3 not-too-long sentences. Don't overwhelm the user. Don't mention specific numerical stats or underlined_categories from the session data below. Use a coaching tone.
